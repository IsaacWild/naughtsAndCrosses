# naughtsAndCrosses

This is my 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game for the Odin project.

## Description

This is the Tic-Tac-Toe or Naughts and Crosses game (fight between yourselves over what you think it should be called) this project challenged us to have as little global code as possible and got us to try to move everything we could into a module or a factory function. I went with a mobile-first design ensuring that the layout was clean and easy to understand. I also implemented code to ensure that buttons were only useable when intended so that a misclick or tap wouldn't restart a game partway through or cause any other issues. 

To return to this project I would like to include an ai opponent so that you can play it by yourself and I would also like to clean up the code that checks for a win to a more simple solution possibly checking through an array or win possibilities to the current gameboard.
